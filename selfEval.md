# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
Time management is definitley an area that I need to work on. I feel like I'm always behind schedule and that time flies super fast, especially when you're on a time crunch. Using google calender has actually really helped me visualiza my time, and has improved my time management skills a little. 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A function basically recieves some inputs and returns/prints an output. We can think of functions as instructions manual for the program to follow.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Parameters are named variables that are used in functions. The parameter is what allows arguments to be implemented into functions.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
Can for statements be implemented into functions, or are they completely seperate?
